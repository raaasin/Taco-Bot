You are expected to have read the rules ahead of participating and be respectful towards your opponents and admins. 

- I have won prize money in the RLCS. What are the next steps? 
You will be contacted by RLCS staff where you will be providing details for payout.

- When does the registration close? 
The deadline to register is the Monday prior to the qualifier starting (4 days before Qualifier Day 1). After that point you will not be able to register or adjust your team's registration.

- What platform can I compete on?
You can compete in the RLCS on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox. You are responsible for your equipment working when competing. 

- How many Regional events take place per split?
There are three Regionals per split. The first two Regionals have their own open qualifier, and the third Regional consists of the top 16 points-earning teams from the split. There are three splits: Fall, Winter and Spring.

Does my team have to re-register on start.gg after making Main Events?
So long as you are in the Top 16 total season RLCS points, I'll automatically add you to relevant stages on start.gg - which means you do not have to re-register on start.gg. 

If you fall outside of the top 16 in total season RLCS points, you have to register for Open Qualifiers on your own.

I have a question, when can I expect an answer? 
Please post your question in ⁠support discord channel and leave some time for your question to be answered. You are expected to have read the ruleset before asking questions. Do not send DMs to Discord administrators.
