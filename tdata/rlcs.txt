RLCS World Championship

In the RLCS 2022-23 World Championship (“RLCS World Championship”), sixteen (16) Teams will
compete across a total of two (2) stages.
The top eight (8) Teams in cumulative RLCS Points from across all Regions will automatically qualify to
participate in the RLCS World Championship (each, a “RLCS World Championship Advancing
Team”) as set out in Section 2.3.6.1.
In addition, the sixteen (16) Teams with the next-highest cumulative RLCS Point totals from across all
Regions will compete in the RLCS 2022-23 World Championship Wildcard (“RLCS World
Championship Wildcard”) as set out in Section 2.3.6.2 to determine the final eight (8) Teams that will
qualify to participate in the RLCS World Championship.
2.3.6.1 RLCS World Championship Advancing Teams
Automatic advancement into the RLCS World Championship will be determined by the cumulative RLCS
Points earned by a Team at the conclusion of the applicable Regional or Major.
At the conclusion of each Major during the applicable Split, Teams will earn RLCS Points toward the eight
(8)-slot pool of RLCS World Championship Advancing Teams (“Slots”) for their respective Region based
on each Team’s placement relative to the other Teams within its Region. By way of example only:
•
•
•

If a North American Team places first (1 st ) in the Fall Major, the NA1 Slot will receive 32 RLCS
Points.
If a North American Team places second (2 nd) to a European Team in the Winter Major, the NA1
Slot will receive 32 RLCS Points (for a total of 64 RLCS Points).
If a North American Team places second (2 nd ) to another North American Team in the Spring
Major, the NA1 Slot will receive 48 RLCS Points (for a total of 112 RLCS Points) and the NA2
Slot will receive 40 RLCS Points.

For clarity, multiple Teams can contribute RLCS Points to the same Slot across multiple Majors, so long
as those Teams are from the same Region.
At the conclusion of the Spring Major, (a) each Slot will be allocated to a Team from the Region associated
Page 23

with such Slot (using the above example, the top Slot would be allocated to a North American Team); and
(b) the top eight (8) Teams in cumulative RLCS Points from the applicable Regions will fill each such Slot
and qualify to participate in the RLCS World Championship as an RLCS World Championship Advancing
Team.
2.3.6.2 RLCS World Championship Wildcard
The top sixteen (16) Teams in cumulative RLCS Points that did not qualify as an RLCS World
Championship Advancing Team will compete in the RLCS World Championship Wildcard to determine
the final eight (8) Teams that will qualify to participate in the RLCS World Championship. The group of
Teams will be constituted as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

North America: Three (3) Teams
Europe: Three (3) Teams
Oceania: Two (2) Teams
South America: Two (2) Teams
APAC: Two (2) Teams
MENA: Two (2) Teams
SSA: Two (2) Teams

Teams will compete in Swiss Matches against other Teams within the group. If a Team wins three (3)
Matches during this stage, it will advance to the RLCS World Championship. If a Team loses three (3)
Matches during this stage, it will be eliminated from the Tournament.
2.3.6.3 RLCS World Championship
In the RLCS World Championship, the eight (8) RLCS World Championship Advancing Teams and the
top eight (8) Teams advancing from the RLCS World Championship Wildcard will compete as one group
of sixteen (16) Teams across a total of two (2) stages, and seeding for each stage of the RLCS World
Championship will be determined using the method set out in Section 2.3.9. It will not be possible to enter
the RLCS World Championship without qualifying as an RLCS World Championship Advancing Team or
advancing from the RLCS World Championship Wildcard as set out in Sections 2.3.6.1 or 2.3.6.2 (as
applicable).
The first stage of the RLCS World Championship will consist of two groups of eight (8) Teams, with each
Team competing in one Double Elimination Bracket. All Matches for the first stage of the RLCS World
Championship will be Best-of-Seven.
The second stage of the RLCS World Championship will consist of an eight (8) Team Single Elimination
Bracket. All Matches for the second stage of the RLCS World Championship will be Best-of-Seven.
2.3.7

Tiebreakers for RLCS Regional, Major, or RLCS World Championship Qualification Spots

In the event of a tie for a Regional, Major, or RLCS World Championship qualification spot, one Best-ofSeven Match will be played amongst the Teams tied.
If more than two (2) Teams are tied, a bracket will be made to accommodate the number of tied Teams,
with Teams receiving “byes” in accordance with the seeding system set out in Sections 2.3.8 or 2.3.9 (as
applicable) (each such bracket, a “Qualification Spot Bracket”). All Matches in a Qualification Spot
Bracket will be Best-of-Seven.

in-person Tournament event, all controllers are subject to approval from Psyonix and/or the Tournament
Administrators.
3.1.3 Arenas
In the Open Qualifier, all Games are played on DFH Stadium. In all other stages of the Tournament, the
map rotation will be chosen from the standard arenas, chosen by Tournament Administrators at their sole
discretion. For broadcasted Matches, Teams may request to avoid an arena due to performance issues and
are required to submit a detailed request to Tournament Administrators no less than 24 -hours prior to the
Match start time. The Tournament Administrators reserve the right to reject for any reason, in their sole
discretion, any request made by Teams to avoid an arena.
3.2 Match Procedures
3.2.1

Hosting and Team Colors

Tournament Administrators will specify which Team is blue and which Team is orange. In the Open
Qualifier, Teams will be instructed how to host the Match. In all other stages of the Tournament, a
Tournament Administrator will host the Match.
3.2.2

Re-Hosts

Between Games in a Match, Teams may request that the Match be re-hosted on the same server region due
to connection issues. During a Main Event, before either (a) a goal has been scored or (b) fifteen (15)
seconds have elapsed (whichever is sooner), Teams may mutually agree to cancel the current Game of the
Match and re-host the Match with approval from Tournament Administrators. Tournament Administrators
reserve the right to suspend and invalidate the current Game of the Match for a re -host at any time.
3.2.3

3.2.4

Game Start

In Open Qualifiers Matches, Players may not join their designated side until three Players from each Team
have joined the Game. In Main Event Matches, Players may not join their designated side until instructed
by a Tournament Administrator.
3.2.5

Substitutions

A “Substitution” is defined as changing the Player line-up after a Match has started.
3.2.5.1 Open Qualifiers
Substitutions are not allowed during a Match in the Open Qualifiers except in the event of a disconnect.
Teams may start a Match with any combination of three (3) Players from their registered Roster (as defined
below).
3.2.5.2 Main Events
Substitutions may only occur in between Games in a Match or before a Match, and Teams are limited to
one Substitution per Match. Teams must inform Tournament Administrators of any change in lineup
between Matches.
3.2.6

Reporting Scores
Page 27

During the Open Qualifier stage, after a Match is completed, the winning Team must submit the Match
result to Tournament Administrators in a designated chatroom. The losing Team must also confirm the
Match result. Taking a screenshot of the results screen or saving the replay file of the Match is required in
case of disputed results. If a Team disputes a Match claiming a win and submits proof of its claim, the other
Team must submit proof of its claim to avoid an automatic forfeit of the Match. Any Teams or Players
found to have submitted false or doctored results will be subject to disciplinary action as further described
in Section 8.2.
3.2.7

Observers

For all Regionals, including Open Qualifiers, Main Events, and Majors, in-game observers are not allowed
except for Tournament Administrators and their designees. Teams that are found to have shared lobby
details for the purposes of allowing an unauthorized observer into the Match will be subject to disciplinary
action as further described in Section 8.2.
Upon written request and approval by Psyonix (email is sufficient), a Player or Team shall be permitted to
stream live coverage of his/her/its Gameplay in the Open Qualifiers and/or Day 1 of the applicable Main
Event through an online streaming platform (e.g., Twitch, YouTube, etc.).
3.2.8

Technical Issues

Due to the nature and scale of online competition, except as otherwise determined by Tournament
Administrators in their sole discretion, Matches will not be restarted or made null due to bugs, intentional
disconnections, server crashes, or unintentional disconnections. Except as otherwise determined by
Tournament Administrators in their sole discretion, any technical issues or bug encounters must be played
through. If a Team calls for a rematch due to a technical issue or bug encounter, such Team they must save
the replay and submit it to the Tournament Administrators for review. During a broadcasted Match,
Tournament Administrators may halt Gameplay to review and subsequently restart the Game if deemed
necessary by Tournament Administrators in their sole discretion.
In addition, Players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Rocket League competitive event the
individual Player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC or console (as applicable)) and
understands that he/she may face Players competing on a different platform. Additionally, Players
acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, Player interface, and/or
ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive
advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and
agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Psyonix relating to such Player’s involvement in a
multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform .
3.3

Team Rosters

3.3.1 Team Captains
Each Team must declare one member of their Roster to be the “Team Captain” who represents the Team
for all official decisions and serves as the main point of contact for the Team; provided, that a Team may
designate its Manager or Coach (as applicable) as the main point of contact for the Team.
3.3.2 Rosters
Teams may only use Players who are on their Roster for a Match. Upon registering for the Tournament,
Page 28

Rosters must have at least three (3) Players, but no more than four (4) (i.e., three starting Players and one
reserve Player who may be used as an alternate). Rosters may also include a Manager and/or a Coach who
do not play in Tournament Matches. An individual may not simultaneously be part of more than one Roster
at a time, including Coaches and Managers.
3.3.3 Roster Submission
Starting Rosters for each Tournament day must be submitted to Tournament Administrators at least 24
hours prior to the start of Gameplay for such day.
3.3.4 Roster Change Period/Roster Lock Deadline
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Rules, Team Rosters may only change during the Transfer
Windows (as defined below). All Rosters will be deemed locked at the close of the Tournament registration
process set out in Section 6.1.3 (the “Registration Process”) at the time and date to be specified on the
Registration Website (such dates and times collectively, the “Roster Lock Deadline”).
If a Team has a Manager or Coach they would like added to its Roster, the Team must notify Tournament
Administrators prior to the applicable Roster Lock Deadline. If a Team has circumstances that prevent it
from making a Substitution within the deadlines set forth in Section 3.2.5 and are in need of a time
extension, such Team must notify a Tournament Administrator by the applicable Roster Lock Deadline.
Otherwise, no Substitution will be allowed for such Team after the Roster Lock Deadline.
3.3.5 Roster Changes/Transfers
As used herein, “Roster Change” means the addition of a new Player to an existing Roster. Note that a
Player departing a Roster will not be considered a Roster Change, provided the Team maintains a minimum
of three (3) Players.
Teams will be allowed to make Roster additions during two designated “Transfer Windows” during the
season.
Transfer Window 1: December 13, 2022 at 12:00 AM PT – January 8, 2023 at 11:59 PM PT
Transfer Window 2: April 11, 2023 at 12:00 AM PT – April 24, 2023 at 11:59 PM PT
During each Transfer Window, Teams may only make one addition to their Roster (not including Manager
and Coach), provided that the maximum number of Players allowed on a Team is four (4). Teams are
allowed to make one addition to their Roster per Transfer Window (for a total of two (2) additions for the
entire RLCS Season). If it is determined by Psyonix and/or a Tournament Administrator that a Team has
made more than one addition in a single Transfer Window, such Team shall forfeit all of its accumulated
RLCS Points and shall become an inactive Team.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Teams may also make one “Exempt” addition to their Rosters (each, an
“Exempt Addition”) during the entire RLCS Season. Exempt Additions must be made in one of the two
(2) Transfer Windows and must be added in the “Substitute” position. In addition, Exempt Additions must
meet the following eligibility criteria:
•

The Exempt Addition must have been eligible to compete for the entirety of the Split immediately
Page 29

•

preceding the Transfer Window during which the Exempt Addition is being made.
The Exempt Addition cannot have earned any RLCS Points during such Split.

In order to make an Exempt Addition, Teams must submit their request via email at the applicable email
address listed below (depending on their Region) before the close of the applicable Transfer Window.

3.3.6 Player or Team Names
Players or Teams may not change their User Names, in-game names, or Team Names without approval
from Tournament Administrators. All such names must comply with these Rules (including, without
limitation, Section 5) and Tournament Administrators may request that they be changed at any time. A
Roster shall not contain duplicates of the same name, names that consist only of symbols, or names that are
difficult to distinguish from one another.
3.3.7 Roster Continuity
A “Roster” is the three (3) or four (4) Players (as applicable) who are registered under a Team. If a Team
has three (3) Players, all three (3) Players will be considered “Starters”. If a Team has four (4) Players, three
(3) Players will be considered “Starters,” and one (1) Player will be considered “Exempt” or a “Substitute”
(as applicable).
3.4

Match Obligations

3.4.1 Punctuality
All Teams must have three (3) Players physically present or in the online Match lobby by the designated
Match start time. Teams that do not have three (3) Players ready to play after five (5) minutes of the Match
start time will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 8.2. During Main Event
matches, the Team Captain must be responsive in the designated chat room at least ten (10) minutes prior
to the designated Match start time. Match start times may be adjusted by Psyonix and/or Tournament
Administrators, in their sole discretion, depending on any Tournament accelerations or delays.
3.4.2 Forfeits
Teams may not voluntarily forfeit a Match without prior authorization from Tournament Administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, even with such authorization, such Teams will be subject to disciplinary
actions as further described in Section 8.2.
3.4.3 Communications
Teams will communicate with their Coaches, opponents, and Tournament Administrators (as applicable)
Page 30

in a designated chatroom during all online stages of the Tournament. For live events, once a Match has
officially begun, communication with anyone not designated as playing within the current Match
(including, without limitation, Coaches) is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate disqualification
of the Player(s) or Team. Psyonix and/or Tournament Administrators will notify Players of the designated
chatroom prior to the start of each stage of the Tournament.
3.5

Match Disruptions

3.5.1 Disconnects
3.5.1.1 Open Qualifier
If a disconnect occurs in the Open Qualifier, the shorthanded Team must continue to play out the single
Game within the Match series. The disconnected Player may rejoin during the Game that the disconnect
occurred in or in between Games of a Match series but may not join in the middle of subsequent Games in
the series. After a disconnect, if the Player cannot rejoin during the same Game, the Player will have five
minutes to rejoin before the next Game of the Match series begins. If the disconnected Player is unable to
join the Game prior to the next Game in the series, the Player’s Team may substitute another Player from
their Roster (subject to the Substitution rules set forth in Section 3.2.5) if this is the first disconnect for the
Team during the series.
3.5.1.2 All Other Stages
If a disconnect occurs during any stage of the Tournament, except for the Open Qualifier, the shorthanded
Team must immediately notify the Tournament Administrators in the designated chatroom. The
Tournament Administrators may pause the Game once the disconnect notification has been received, at
their sole discretion. For spectated / broadcasted Matches, if Tournament Administrators identify that a
Player has disconnected without being notified, they may pause a Match to allow the Player to reconnect.
Once the Game has been paused, the disconnected Player will have eight minutes to rejoin before the Game
resumes. In the event of multiple pauses for disconnections, the total time will be counted towards the eight
minutes of reconnection time. If the Player cannot rejoin within that time, the shorthanded Team will forfeit
the single Game within the Match series.
If the Player does not rejoin during the same Game in which they disconnected, the Player will have three
additional minutes following the Game to rejoin before the next Game of the Match series begins. The
disconnected Player may only rejoin during the Game in which the disconnect occurred in or in between
Games of a Match series but may not join in the middle of subsequent Games in the series. If the
disconnected Player is unable to join the Game prior to the next Game in the series, the Player’s Team must
substitute another Player from their roster (subject to the Substitution rules set forth in Section 3.2.5) or
forfeit the Match.
Once the disconnected Player rejoins the Game or the allotted rejoin time has expired, the Teams have 30
seconds to confirm with Tournament Administrators that each Team is ready to unpause. Once each Team
has confirmed its readiness, the Game will resume from a neutral kickoff or from continuation of play as
determined by the Tournament Administrators.
If a Team cannot field a full team of three (3) Players to continue play, it will forfeit the Game. If a Team
cannot field a full team of three (3) Players in the subsequent eight minutes of Game forfeiture, they will
forfeit the Match.

Page 31

3.5.2 Stoppage of Play
Tournament Administrators may pause a Game or Match at any time and for any reason. In the event of a
stoppage of play, Players must remain at their devices and may not communicate with other Players until
the Game or Match is resumed. Each Team is allowed a maximum of one pause request per Match.
3.5.3 Timeouts
For any Best-of-Seven series, Teams may request one (1) timeout (each, a “Timeout”) between Games
during such series.
For any Best-of-Five set or Best-of-Seven set, Teams may request one (1) Timeout between Games during
such set (as applicable).
Each Timeout will last for two (2) minutes. A Team must notify a Tournament Administrator immediately
after the conclusion of a Game if it elects to use a Timeout. Tournament Administrators reserve the right to
deny a Team a Timeout if such Team fails to make its election in accordance with the deadlines set forth in
this Section 3.5.3. At the conclusion of the Timeout, Tournament Administrators will confirm that each
Team is ready to continue the series before Gameplay can resume.
For clarity, Timeouts cannot be used in Open Qualifiers or during Gameplay. In addition, Timeouts cannot
be used to extend or circumvent disqualification timers as set forth in Section 3.5.1.2.
3.5.4 Restarts
Tournament Administrators may order a Game or Match restart due to exceptional circumstances, such as
if a bug significantly affects a Player’s ability to play or the Game or Match is disrupted by a Force Majeure
or other event.
3.5.5 Log Submission
If a Player or Team makes a complaint that results in a Game or Match restart, they shall provide
Tournament Administrators with log files from the Game or Match. These log files will be subject to
investigation, and if Tournament Administrators determine that the restart was falsely requested, such
Player or Team will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 8.2 .

Prizing Information

Only Winning Players (as determined by Psyonix pursuant to this Section 4.5) will be eligible to receive

to any surplus between actual retail value of prize and approximate retail value and any difference between
approximate and actual value of the prize will not be awarded. Winning Players are responsible for any
costs and expenses associated with prize acceptance and use not specified herein as being provided.
Winning Players may not substitute a prize, but Psyonix reserves the right, at its sole discretion, in case of
justified reasons, to substitute a prize (or portion thereof) with one of comparable or greater value.
Additional terms and conditions may apply to acceptance and use of a prize.
Upon formal notification from Psyonix, a potential Winning Player shall have 45 days from the date such
notice was emailed to respond and provide any information or materials requested by Psyonix, including
the Release (as defined below) for purposes of verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 5. Such
response from a potential Winning Player must be delivered to the email address from which Psyonix’s
notification was sent or, at Psyonix’s sole option, another email address specified in the notification. In
addition, a potential Winning Player must keep the Epic Account (as defined below) that he or she provided
to Psyonix pursuant to Section 5.3 active throughout the verification of eligibility process.
The date of receipt by Psyonix shall be decisive for a potential Winning Player’s compliance with the
deadlines set forth in this Section 4.5. In the event of (a) the failure by any such Player to (i) keep the Epic
Account that he or she provided to Psyonix pursuant to Section 5.3 active throughout the verification of
eligibility process or (ii) timely respond to any notification or request for materials or information; or (b)

Page 38

(ii) attempting to complete the verification of eligibility process with a Cabined Account, or (iii) failure to
provide the necessary tax and payment information through Psyonix’s approved tax and payment
processing vendors), then in either case (items (a) or (b)), such Player shall be disqualified, and such Player
shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Tournament. In such cases, no alternate
Winning Player will be named, and Psyonix shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (y)
award any prize amounts that would have otherwise been awarded to such disqualified Player as part of a
future Rocket League tournament or (z) award any such prize amounts to non-profit causes and efforts. A
Winning Player will only be announced once the verification of eligibility process has been completed by
Psyonix pursuant to these Rules.
Winning Players will also be required to provide certain payment information to Psyonix, including any
required tax information forms, in order to receive the prizes. Psyonix may withhold payment of the prizes
if the Winning Player fails to provide the applicable payment forms to Psyonix in a timely manner.
PRIZES ARE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL
TAXES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES) AND IT IS
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH WINNING PLAYER TO (I) CHECK WITH HIS OR HER LOCAL
TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE WHICH TAXES APPLY TO HIM OR HER AND (II) PAY SUCH
TAXES TO THE APPROPRIATE TAX AUTHORITY. It is Psyonix's policy to withhold tax at the backup
withholding rates in effect for US and non-US residents. Prize income and tax withholding will be reported
on forms (y) 1099-MISC for US residents and 1042-S for non-US residents, and (z) any other relevant tax
forms as may be required by applicable law.
Psyonix will determine the payment method for the prizes in its sole discretion and, except as otherwise
required by applicable law, all payments will be made directly to the Winning Player in his or her capacity
as an individual (or, if a Minor, to the Winning Player’s parent or legal guardian). Each Winning Player
will be provided a Prize Acceptance and Release Form (“Release”). Unless restricted by applicable law,

collected and used pursuant to this Section, or their choices and rights regarding such use, please see the
